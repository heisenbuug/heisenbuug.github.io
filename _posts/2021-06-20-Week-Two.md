So this is a 2 week completion update. 

I completed the implementation of types in mlpack by creating a new file in `mlpack/core/data/`
* types.hpp
* types_impl.hpp

Currently these files have:
* enum structure for valid file types
* a convert fucntion which converts `arma::file_type` to `mlpack::file_type`

This week was more about restructuring the existing code and changing the design a bit. As I have mentioned already that we are chaning the template parameter from `eT` to `MatType` this will require some modifications in the design as well.

Files which required changes:
* save.hpp
* save_impl.hpp
* detect_file_type.cpp
* detect_file_type.hpp

As we are now making sure that user can use any type of matrix, user should also be able to save any kind of matrix thus changes in the structure of `save()` as well. Most replacements are easy and just to make the fucntion more generic.

Plan for the coming week is to remove the `load.cpp`. This should not be much difficult, I am hoping to encounter some include errors.

Let's see how it goes!!!
