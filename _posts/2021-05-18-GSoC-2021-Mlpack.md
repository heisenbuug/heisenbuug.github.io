I am very exicted to announce that my project [Replacing Boost Spirits](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5302310432931840) has been accepted and this marks the start of an awesome summer. First of all thank you mlpack for choosing my proposal. Thank you [Omar Shrit](https://github.com/shrit) for providing insightful comments and suggestions on my draft proposal. My mentor will be [Omar Shrit](https://github.com/shrit) for this project. I will be working on replacing the boost spirits by implemnting a csv parser to increase performace and reduce binary footprint. We will be adapting [Armadillo's](https://gitlab.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code) csv parser for mlpack to be exact. Let's have fun coding!!!
