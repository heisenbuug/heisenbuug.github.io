Mlpack is an awesome community. We also have a tradition of having video meet-up on 1st and 3rd friday of every month.
[Marcus Edel](https://github.com/zoq) sent us a detailed mail about how mlpack goes around GSoC and some other useful information.
We also had a kickoff meeting which was fun.

Key takes from the meeting:
* Never hesitate in asking doubts
* [Marcus's](https://github.com/zoq) 15 min rule

This year mlpack has selected 8 students. We had some fun introductions and some general discussion followed by a great presentation
by [Ryan Curtin](https://github.com/rcurtin) on how the program will proceed.

I also had a meeting with my mentor [Omar Shrit](https://github.com/shrit). We discussed about embedded systems and rasberry pi and
some more project specific discussion.

I am very glad that I am part of such a wonderful community.
