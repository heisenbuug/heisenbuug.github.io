End of week 5 was a bit progressive, although I didn't write much code I went though a whole lot
of code related to `DatasetMapper`. I got to see some really beautifully written code by [Ryan](https://github.com/rcurtin)
and Keon. My mentor told me in the start of the project that, "your project is a bit different as
it involves more of reading others code and making changes to it rather than writing your own code
from strach". Well now I am understanding what [Omar](https://github.com/shrit) meant.

I think I should write another article totally dedicated to `DatasetMapper` talking about how it
works and what it adds to mlpack. Also it's not at all fair that such well written implementation
is not being noticed by the mlpack users.

Currently `DatasetMapper` uses the parser based on `boost`. Our goal is to remove all the boost part
and replace it with our new parser's fucntionality.

Code that loads the data and creates the `DatasetMapper` object resides in `load_csv.hpp`
(master branch). We have to types of parse here:

* TransposeParse
* NonTransposeParse

Depending on the type of parse we have two other ulitity fucntions

* GetMatrixSize
* GetTransposeMatrixSize

Curently I am done refactoring the above mentioned utility fucntions. I am able to build mlpack
after refactoring but that only confirms the syntactical part of the code. I am getting some issues
in running the tests. 

When `Load()` is being called from `load_save_test.cpp` it is not selecting the proper overload
in case of sparse matrix. It is calling the overload that is for dense matrix and therefore it
is throwing errors. Solving this error might mean I have to revisit the SFINAE.

The issue is due to changes in the design of the code. I hope to solve the error and underlying
issue in the coming week so  I can test the parser properly as something like  parser requires
extensive testing so that we don't miss any use case.

I think that would be it for this week, I hope I can come up with an article on `DatasetMapper`
with the next week's update.

PS. This week was very exhaustive as I was relocating, so I had to take some days off the project.
Thank you [Omar](https://github.com/shrit) for your continous support though out the phase.
