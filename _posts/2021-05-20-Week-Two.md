So this is a 2 week completion update. 

I completed the implementation of types in mlpack by creating a new file in `mlpack/core/data/`
* types.hpp
* types_impl.hpp

Currently these files have:
* enum structure for valid file types
* a convert fucntion which converts `arma::file_type` to `mlpack::file_type`

This week was more about restructuring the existing code and changing the design a bit. As I have mentioned already that we are chaning the template parameter from `eT` to `MatType` this will require some modifications in the design as well.
