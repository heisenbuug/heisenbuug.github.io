Although I need to focus more on failing test cases and make necessary changes to the code. Boost was doing a lot of work behind the scenes, it kinda a lot of work to see and replace eveything but it's fun to explore soo much code.","category":"GSoC","title":"Experience: Week Seven"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/g-so-c/","slug":"/posts/week-six"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-07-18","description":"This week was a lot about dealing with errors.

Things are going as planned, although I really feel might have worked a little bit faster but my mentor made me understand that estimating development time is not easy and there will be many things which we don't see at the start of the project. You learn from experiences so lets keep coding!!!","category":"GSoC","title":"Experience: Week Four"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"GSoC","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/category/g-so-c","nextPagePath":"/category/g-so-c/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
