This week we mostly worked on optimizing the parsing related code and
getting all test cases pass. We are also thinking about a bit of
refactoring in code design but we will msotly handle that later as there
are still more things to consider.

We came up with a way to parse categorical data and pass all test cases,
there is some scope of improvement in the logic maybe but it works well
for now and supports everything that mlpack use to. Logic is here

```
if (token[0] == '"' && token[token.size() - 1] != '"')
{
  std::string tok = token;

  while (token[token.size() - 1] != '"')
  {
    tok += delim;
    std::getline(lineStream, token, delim);
    tok += token;
  }

  token = tok;
}
```

Consider this example
`1,2,"string, with comma",3`

Basically as we are using `getline(lineStream, token, ',')` it will read
the string in-between the commas. So as we will reach the 3rd column we will
first have
* `token = "string"` but this is not the complete token
*  save this token value in a string and append `,` at the end
*  repeat step 1 & 2 till we have `"` as the last char of the token

Also [Conrad]() suggested a way to handle `sparse matrix` which is just a
small addition in our `csv parse` for dense matrix. That helps a lot as
now we can remove the `Load()` which we have specifically for sparse matrix.

There are some issues with removing the `Load()` for sp_mat as this logic
only handles sparse matrix in `csv` format and not other formats like `txt`,
`bin` and `tsv`.

We will handle it but first let's concentrate on `csv parse` only.
